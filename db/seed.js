  },
  {
    title: "Mildly Inappropriate",

    price: 29.99,
    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}mildly-inappropriate.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Pain & Citrus",

    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}pain-and-citrus.png`
  },
  {
    title: "The Reaper's Kiss",

    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}reapers-kiss.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Hipster Tears",

    price: 29.99,
    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}hipster-tears.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Flannel Inferno",
    description: "Like chopping wood shirtless in the fall â€” sweet maple upfront, with a cayenne burn that sneaks in after. Ideal on pancakes, bacon, or literally any brunch plate you Instagram.",

    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}flannel-inferno.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Burnout Culture",

    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}burnout-culture.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Artisan Regret",
    description: "Balanced acidity with a swift kick. Apple cider vinegar cuts through the richness, but the red habanero ensures you won't forget who's boss. Pairs well with roasted pork and existential dread.",
    price: 29.99,
    image_url: `${CLOUDINARY_BASE_URL}artisan-regret.png`
  },
  {
    title: "Sweat Equity",
